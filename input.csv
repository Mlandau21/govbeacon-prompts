"The Department of the Air Force (“DAF”) is accepting proposals for the development of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) data centers (“Projects”). These Projects are in accordance with Executive Order 14179: Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence dated 23 January 2025 and Executive Order 14318: Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure dated 23 July 2025. Projects must, at a minimum, be “Qualifying Projects” as defined in Executive Order 14318 (at Appendix A) including, but not limited to, a facility that requires greater than 100 megawatts (MW) of new load and a Project of at least $500M in capital expenditures. As consideration for leasing its parcels to developers selected under this RFLP, DAF is seeking monetary consideration for the AI data center. If an onsite power generation component is included in the proposal, then the DAF will require the first right of refusal to power generation.
Executive Order 13327, Federal Real Property Asset Management, establishes “It is the policy of the United States to promote the efficient and economical use of America’s real property assets and to assure management accountability for implementing Federal real property management reforms.” Furthermore, policy from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations) directs, “The Air Force cannot afford to disregard or discount the value of any asset, and we must optimize the real and potential value of those assets ….”
a. 10 U.S.C. § 2667 (the “Enabling Statute”), as amended, allows the Government to lease real property to non-Federal entities in exchange for consideration in an amount that is not less than the fair market value of the leasehold interest.
b. Pursuant to the foregoing Executive Orders and the Enabling Statute, the DAF (herein, the “Government”) is issuing this Request for Lease Proposal (this “RFLP”) to solicit proposals from qualified entities (individually an “Offeror” and collectively “Offerors”) interested in leasing from the Government one or more underutilized parcels of land (each a “Property” and collectively the “Properties”) for private commercial data center use on Arnold Air Force Base (AFB), TN, Edwards AFB, CA, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL), NJ, Davis- Monthan AFB, AZ, and Robins AFB, GA (each, an “Installation” and collectively, the “Installations”), which are all active military installations located within the contiguous United States. Each Property and associated acreage is depicted in Appendix B-1 through B-5 of this RFLP (“Depiction of Properties”), along with additional information. Offerors are not required to submit development proposals for all Installations but instead can choose to submit proposals for Installations in which the Offeror feels a project is commercially viable. The Government may purchase AI Data Center services and power from the Project(s) but is under no obligation to do so.
c. In accordance with and subject to the terms, requirements, and conditions of this RFLP, the Government will evaluate all proposals received to select one or more Offerors as potential lessee(s) with whom to enter into lease negotiations
(individually a “Potential Lessee” and collectively “Potential Lessees”). A Potential Lessee(s) with whom the Government executes a legally binding written long-term ground lease agreement (“Lease”) is hereinafter referred to in this RFLP as a “Lessee(s).” A Potential Lessee(s) may not actually become a Lessee if lease negotiations are not successful.

The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is issuing a Request for Lease Proposal (RFLP) for the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centers in accordance with Executive Orders aimed at enhancing American leadership in AI and accelerating federal permitting for data center infrastructure.

The goal is to lease underutilized parcels of land at various military installations for private commercial data center use, with a focus on projects that require significant capital investment and energy load.

Work Details
The selected Offerors will be responsible for developing AI data centers that meet the criteria of 'Qualifying Projects' as defined in Executive Order 14318, which includes facilities requiring over 100 megawatts (MW) of new load and a minimum of $500 million in capital expenditures.

The Offerors must provide monetary consideration for leasing the properties and may include an onsite power generation component, granting DAF first right of refusal to any generated power.

III.      BACKGROUND

     a.  SERVICES OVERVIEW

IFS Software is a Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software that the FAA configures for the FAA’s Supply Chain Management ERP (SCM-ERP) platform.  The SCM-ERP platform is all-inclusive of the IFS ERP plus all the interfaces, systems, and technologies.  The IFS ERP has been actively supporting the FAA since implementation in 2016.  The FAA is currently upgrading from IFS App 10 to IFS Cloud with estimated completion in 2027.  The IFS ERP interfaces with as many as 10 other systems performing functions related to Purchase Requests (PRs), Purchase Orders (POs), Shop Orders (SOs), Customer Orders (COs), Projects, Financial Administration, and multiple other functions supporting the FAA Supply Chain.   The SCM-ERP platform (and thereby the IFS ERP) supports three (3) business sectors:  1. Facilities & Equipment Project Materiel Management (F&E PMM) responsible for deploying new systems to the National Airspace System (NAS).  2. The FAA Logistics Center (FAALC) who supplies parts to maintain existing systems within the NAS. 3. Configuration Management Automation (CMA) responsible for the system specifications throughout the NAS. 

The FAA plans to leverage industry input and best practices to continue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the FAA Supply Chain.  In doing so, the FAA intends to address opportunities within the technical infrastructure, to implement additional functionalities within the IFS ERP, and to conduct Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) to make best use of the IFS ERP.   Industry’s best practice experience and expertise is required to further progress toward these goals.     

IV.       OBJECTIVES

The new IFS Services should achieve the following high-level objectives:

Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the FAA Supply Chain by applying industry’s best practices, implementing additional functionalities available within the IFS ERP, and conducting BPR where applicable.
Automate inefficient manual processes by leveraging the IFS ERP. 
Provide informed FAA-specific advice regarding the FAA SCM-ERP infrastructure, and both the Technical and Business Process applications of the IFS ERP.
Achieve a base continuity of knowledge which is sustained through the ebb and flow of work for the SCM-ERP platform.
Provide FAA-specific training when needed related to the IFS ERP.
Introduce new technologies which may further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the FAA Supply Chain while complying with FAA Security and System Specification requirements.
Support the FAA in establishing and sustaining an enhanced and evolving FAA Supply Chain Strategic Roadmap by leveraging informed FAA resources. 
Support the FAA in achieving more effective and efficient Investment Analysis (IA) by leveraging informed FAA resources throughout the FAA investment lifecycle including but not limited to: Requirements Definition, Solution Design, Work Breakdown Structure definition, Cost Estimating, Schedule Estimating, and Shortfalls / Benefits analysis.     
V.        REQUESTED INFORMATION / QUESTIONS TO INDUSTRY

The FAA plans to evolve and modernize the FAA Supply Chain and the supporting SCM-ERP platform.  A key strategy of the FAA is to leverage industry’s best practices to make the most of the existing technologies within the SCM-ERP and implement new technologies consistent with industry leaders in Supply Chain Management.  The FAA believes that integrating IFS ERP best practices into planning and implementation of strategic initiatives will be a key factor in ensuring the FAA Supply Chain achieves and sets the standard for world-class performance.
