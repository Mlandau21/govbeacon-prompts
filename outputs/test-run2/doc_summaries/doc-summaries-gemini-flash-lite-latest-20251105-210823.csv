Notice of Availability (NoA) / Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO)

### Purpose & Overview
This Notice of Availability (NoA) announces a Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) by the Defense Health Agency (DHA) PEO DHMS to award Other Transaction Agreements (OTAs) under 10 U.S.C. § 4022 for prototype projects related to **Customer Care Prototyping 2025-2026**.

### Prototype Project Scope
The goal is to rapidly and incrementally establish a **Customer Care Foundational Platform** using prototypes and experiments, moving away from traditional, high-cost change management practices. Prototype projects may include proof of concept, agile development, pilot applications of commercial tech, or demonstration of operational utility.

### Fundamental Prototype Questions
The CSO seeks solutions to address issues where technology velocity outpaces user adoption, specifically questioning:
*   Targeting the right industry partners.
*   Customer definition and focus.
*   Reducing Government civilian bottlenecks.
*   Improving instrumentation beyond ticket counting.
*   Reducing dependence on legacy ITSM mentalities.
*   Maximizing self-service paradigms.
*   Adopting payment models based on insights/successes.

### Areas of Interest
Key areas include proactive service management (replacing traditional ITSM), embedding customer experience via design principles, utilizing insight-driven approaches, emerging neural technologies (ML, GenAI), and adopting RevOps principles in a non-revenue organization.

### Goals
Primary goals are to reduce onboarding delays, significantly reduce dependency on human touch and expenses, reverse low customer sentiment, and allow customer care insights to inform product design.

### Process & Submission
*   **Process:** The CSO uses a phased approach organized into **Seasons**, each with unified timelines (Prospecting, Assessing, Kickstarting, Episodes).
*   **Season Notices:** Specific rules, Areas of Interest (AOI), evaluation criteria, and deadlines will be detailed in subsequent **Season Notices** attached to the main posting.
*   **Eligibility:** Submissions must demonstrate **Advancement** (improvement over status quo), **Learning** (testing a hypothesis), **Adjusting** (mechanisms for real-time change), and **Solutions** (specific, measurable outcomes, not just labor hours).
*   **Follow-on:** Successful prototypes may lead to follow-on production agreements under 10 U.S.C. § 4022(f).

### Key Terms for Bidders
*   Awards are **not** subject to the Competition in Contracting Act or FAR/DFARS.
*   Bidders must cooperate with other contractors (teaming agreements may be required).
*   Security clearances, HIPAA compliance (for PII/PHI), and potential restrictions (e.g., no foreign nationals) are likely requirements.
*   The Government will **not** pay for costs associated with preparing materials for merit determination.
