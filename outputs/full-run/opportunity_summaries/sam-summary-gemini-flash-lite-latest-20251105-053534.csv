### **Purpose & Background**
The FAA is conducting a Request for Information (RFI) to gather industry expertise regarding the Supply Chain Management - Enterprise Resource Planning (SCM-ERP) platform, which utilizes the IFS ERP (currently upgrading from IFS App 10 to IFS Cloud by 2027). The goal is to leverage industry best practices to advise the FAA on the technical and business process application of IFS within the FAA Supply Chain context, covering three sectors: F&E PMM, FAALC, and CMA. This RFI is for market research only; it is not a solicitation, and no proposals are being accepted.

### **Key Requirements / Scope (Based on Draft PWS Input)**
While this is an RFI, the anticipated future requirement involves expert services to support the CLMRS SCM-ERP Solution, focusing on IFS optimization *without* source code modification. Key areas of interest include:
*   Advising on IFS optimization, Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), and automation of manual processes.
*   Providing continuity of knowledge for the IFS ERP platform.
*   Supporting the upgrade from IFS App 10 to IFS Cloud.
*   Advising on Investment Analysis (IA) and developing a Supply Chain Strategic Roadmap.
*   Services are anticipated to span one base year plus four option years.

### **Submission & Evaluation Details**
This is a market survey; responses are for informational purposes only.
*   **Format:** Submissions must be in Microsoft Word format (Times New Roman, 12pt) and cannot exceed 18 pages (10 MB limit). Optional technical diagrams (max 3 pages) are permitted.
*   **Content:** Responders should address specific questions regarding IFS expertise (Cloud vs. App 10), best practices, BPR experience, and OCM processes. Capability statements are explicitly *not* desired.
*   **Deadline:** The closing date has been extended to **November 5, 2025, at 3:00 PM CT**.
*   **Submission Method:** Email only to Stephanie.R.Riddle@faa.gov. Subject line must be: `CLMRS SCM-ERP [Company Name]`.
