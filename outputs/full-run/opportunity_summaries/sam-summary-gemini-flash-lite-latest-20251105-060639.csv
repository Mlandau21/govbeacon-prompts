### **Scope of Work & Objectives**
The FAA requires expert advisory services focused on leveraging industry best practices to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the FAA Supply Chain, which is supported by the IFS ERP platform. The contractor is expected to possess deep, pre-existing expertise in applying IFS ERP in a Supply Chain context.

Key objectives for future services include:
*   Improving supply chain effectiveness via best practices and implementing additional IFS functionalities.
*   Automating inefficient manual processes within the ERP.
*   Providing informed advice on the SCM-ERP infrastructure, technical applications, and business processes.

The Draft PWS indicates that future contract services will involve providing expert support across various Task Orders (TOs), including IFS optimization (without source code modification), program management, financial automation support, and implementation guidance for the ongoing IFS Cloud upgrade. The period of performance for a potential resulting contract is anticipated to be one base year plus four option years (5 years total).
