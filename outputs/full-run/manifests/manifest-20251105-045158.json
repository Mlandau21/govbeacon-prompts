        "description": "The Department of the Air Force (\u201cDAF\u201d) is accepting proposals for the development of Artificial Intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) data centers (\u201cProjects\u201d). These Projects are in accordance with Executive Order 14179: Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence dated 23 January 2025 and Executive Order 14318: Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure dated 23 July 2025. Projects must, at a minimum, be \u201cQualifying Projects\u201d as defined in Executive Order 14318 (at Appendix A) including, but not limited to, a facility that requires greater than 100 megawatts (MW) of new load and a Project of at least $500M in capital expenditures. As consideration for leasing its parcels to developers selected under this RFLP, DAF is seeking monetary consideration for the AI data center. If an onsite power generation component is included in the proposal, then the DAF will require the first right of refusal to power generation.\n\nExecutive Order 13327, Federal Real Property Asset Management, establishes \u201cIt is the policy of the United States to promote the efficient and economical use of America\u2019s real property assets and to assure management accountability for implementing Federal real property management reforms.\u201d Furthermore, policy from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations) directs, \u201cThe Air Force cannot afford to disregard or discount the value of any asset, and we must optimize the real and potential value of those assets \u2026.\u201d\n\na. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2667 (the \u201cEnabling Statute\u201d), as amended, allows the Government to lease real property to non-Federal entities in exchange for consideration in an amount that is not less than the fair market value of the leasehold interest.\n\nb. Pursuant to the foregoing Executive Orders and the Enabling Statute, the DAF (herein, the \u201cGovernment\u201d) is issuing this Request for Lease Proposal (this \u201cRFLP\u201d) to solicit proposals from qualified entities (individually an \u201cOfferor\u201d and collectively \u201cOfferors\u201d) interested in leasing from the Government one or more underutilized parcels of land (each a \u201cProperty\u201d and collectively the \u201cProperties\u201d) for private commercial data center use on Arnold Air Force Base (AFB), TN, Edwards AFB, CA, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL), NJ, Davis- Monthan AFB, AZ, and Robins AFB, GA (each, an \u201cInstallation\u201d and collectively, the \u201cInstallations\u201d), which are all active military installations located within the contiguous United States. Each Property and associated acreage is depicted in Appendix B-1 through B-5 of this RFLP (\u201cDepiction of Properties\u201d), along with additional information. Offerors are not required to submit development proposals for all Installations but instead can choose to submit proposals for Installations in which the Offeror feels a project is commercially viable. The Government may purchase AI Data Center services and power from the Project(s) but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nc. In accordance with and subject to the terms, requirements, and conditions of this RFLP, the Government will evaluate all proposals received to select one or more Offerors as potential lessee(s) with whom to enter into lease negotiations\n\n(individually a \u201cPotential Lessee\u201d and collectively \u201cPotential Lessees\u201d). A Potential Lessee(s) with whom the Government executes a legally binding written long-term ground lease agreement (\u201cLease\u201d) is hereinafter referred to in this RFLP as a \u201cLessee(s).\u201d A Potential Lessee(s) may not actually become a Lessee if lease negotiations are not successful.\n\nPrimary NAICS codes include:\n\n531190 Lessors of Other Real Estate Property\n\nResponses are due no later than 5:00 PM Central Time on 14 November 2025.\n\nPlease direct all pertinent questions to David Mairs david.mairs@us.af.mil or 361-290-3400\n\nAttachments: Attachment 1 - RFLP No. AFCEC-26-R-0002",

Facilities & Equipment Project Materiel Management (F&E PMM) responsible for deploying new systems to the National Airspace System (NAS).\u00a0 2. The FAA Logistics Center (FAALC) who supplies parts to maintain existing systems within the NAS. 3.
